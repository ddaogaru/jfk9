## CDN Cache Invalidation

## Video Fix Applied
The hero section video looping issue has been fixed:
- âœ… Added native `loop` attribute to the video element

## Access Your Site
Your website is served through the load balancer at IP `34.54.31.17`. 
If you have a domain configured, it should be accessible via your domain name.

## Next Steps
1. Wait 2-5 minutes for CDN cache invalidation to complete
2. Clear your browser cache or use incognito mode to test
3. Verify the video plays and loops correctly on both desktop and mobile
4. Monitor for any issues

## Google Analytics (GA4)
- The GA tag is injected globally from `app/layout.tsx` using `next/script` with the ID `G-1LRLX1793N`.
- To override per environment, set the env var `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` (e.g., in Cloud Run or `.env`) and rebuild/deploy.
- The script runs client-side after hydration (`afterInteractive`) and exposes `window.gtag` for custom events (see `hooks/use-analytics.ts`).

## Rollback (if needed)
To rollback, you can re-run the deployment with a previous build or restore from GCS bucket versioning.
