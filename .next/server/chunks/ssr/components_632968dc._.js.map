Not only is Larry an exceptional trainer, but the event itself was hosted flawlessly by Rob and his team at Joint Forces K9. From start to finish, everything was handled in a truly professional way; refreshments and pastries were provided for attendees in the morning, the atmosphere was welcoming, and the event was run with an attention to detail that made it smooth and enjoyable for everyone.\\n\\nAs a professional dog trainer myself, and someone who is passionate about hosting training seminars, I had the chance to speak with Rob about the possibility of him hosting an event for me. From that very first conversation, it was clear that Rob is not only professional and courteous, but also genuinely invested in making each seminar a success. He took care of everything: promotion, logistics, hospitality, and creating a supportive environment. All I had to do was show up and train.\\n\\nThis was especially meaningful to me, as it was the first dog training seminar I taught in three years. Rob\\'s professionalism, strong reputation for bringing in some of the best trainers in the world, and the warm welcome he extended made my return to teaching at workshops an unforgettable experience.\\n\\nRob, I can\\'t thank you enough. Your commitment to excellence, both in running your business and supporting the dog training community, is second to none. For anyone considering attending or hosting a seminar, I can say with confidence that Joint Forces K9 is one of the very best places you could choose.',\n      avatar: '/nate_schoemer.png',\n      googleReviewUrl: 'https://maps.app.goo.gl/hvfrNeoy73VT7t3Y6'\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'Jeff Eastburn',\n      role: 'Google Review 09/30/2025',\n      content: 'I had the opportunity to attend a dog training seminar at Joint Forces K9 Group with Nate Schoemer, and it was an amazing experience from start to finish.

He shared his deep knowledge of canine behavior and training in a way that was both easy to understand and incredibly practical. His teaching style kept everyone engaged, and he made sure all participants felt included, whether they were beginners or more experienced handlers.\\n\\nThe combination of Nate\\'s expertise and Joint Forces K9 Group\\'s top-notch hosting made this seminar one of the best training events I\\'ve attended. I left feeling more confident as a handler and excited to apply what I learned. I would recommend any of the services offered by Joint Forces K9 Group, and I highly recommend attending any event they put on—you won\\'t be disappointed.',\n      avatar: '/jeff_eastburn.png',\n      googleReviewUrl: 'https://maps.app.goo.gl/ViEVmKnDVvPn1vSt9'\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'JST',\n      role: 'Google Review 08/06/2025',\n      content: 'Awesome group to work with.

With a mix of stubbornness, smarts, and serious drive (thanks to her unique breed blend), June needed someone with the right balance of structure, intuition, and heart. Enter Dylan. From the start, it was clear he simply gets dogs. He met June exactly where she was, saw through her sass and smarts, and brought out the best in her. While we’re still convinced not even Cesar Millan himself could fully conquer her potty training — Dylan cracked her code turning chaos into something teachable, and gave us back a dog who’s starting to learn how to channel all that energy in the right direction. And best of all? She loved him. We’re glad she’s in such capable hands and genuinely looking forward to what he’ll help her accomplish after her upcoming session next month.',\n      avatar: '/lindsay_wilson.png',\n      googleReviewUrl: 'https://maps.app.goo.gl/hdExuiBP9aYSSkEe8'\n    }\n  ];\n\n  const TestimonialCard = ({ testimonial, index }: { testimonial: typeof testimonials[0], index: number }) => (\n    <div \n      className=\"flex-shrink-0 w-[260px] sm:w-[300px] md:w-[340px] bg-gradient-to-br from-[#0A3161]/10 to-[#B31942]/10 rounded-xl p-3 sm:p-4 md:p-5 border border-border/50 shadow-sm mx-1 cursor-pointer hover:shadow-md transition-all duration-200 hover:border-[#B31942]/30\"\n      onClick={() => {\n        if (testimonial.googleReviewUrl) {\n          window.open(testimonial.googleReviewUrl, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer');\n        }\n      }}\n    >\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground mb-4 font-medium line-clamp-4\">{testimonial.content}</p>\n  <div className=\"flex items-center gap-2.5\">\n        <Image \n          src={testimonial.avatar} \n          alt={testimonial.name}\n          width={40}\n          height={40}\n          className=\"rounded-full object-cover\"\n          sizes=\"40px\"\n          loading={index < 3 ?
