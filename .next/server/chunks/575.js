As a young man, fueled by a sense of duty, I proudly served my country by joining the US Army Reserves. Alongside my military service, I discovered a passion for coaching high school lacrosse and found love in the embrace of my beautiful wife.

However, it wasn't until I welcomed Jefe, my Belgian Malinois, into my life around 2020, that my journey into the world of dog training truly began. From that moment, dog training became my consuming passion. I embarked on a path of continuous learning, obtaining my K9 instructor certification and attending numerous seminars to deepen my understanding of this intricate field.

As my expertise grew, I found fulfillment in sharing my knowledge with others, eagerly assisting in training my neighbors' dogs and witnessing the transformational impact it had on their lives. It became increasingly clear that my future lay in the realm of professional dog training.

That realization led me to take the next pivotal step in my career by applying at Joint Forces K9.

His one-of-a-kind personality sparked a deep curiosity in me and opened the door to the world of dog training. What began as a passion soon turned into a purpose—I dedicated hundreds of hours volunteering at animal shelters and working hands-on with dogs from all walks of life. These experiences taught me to navigate a wide range of breeds, temperaments, and behavioral challenges with patience and insight.

To further hone my skills, I spent a year training under a professional PSA decoy, where I deepened my understanding of canine drive, protection work, and the subtle art of communication between human and dog. While I value all aspects of training, I'm especially drawn to the complexity and connection found in tracking. With the help of my younger dog, Pippin, I've discovered a deep appreciation for tapping into a dog's natural scenting instincts—and the incredible bond that forms when we learn to follow their lead.`,image:"/trey.png"},{id:"member-6",name:"Bella",role:"Kennel Technician",description:`Bella's passion for animals began early, sparked by the family dogs she adored.
