These experiences taught me to navigate a wide range of breeds, temperaments, and behavioral challenges with patience and insight.\n\nTo further hone my skills, I spent a year training under a professional PSA decoy, where I deepened my understanding of canine drive, protection work, and the subtle art of communication between human and dog. While I value all aspects of training, I'm especially drawn to the complexity and connection found in tracking. With the help of my younger dog, Pippin, I've discovered a deep appreciation for tapping into a dog's natural scenting instincts—and the incredible bond that forms when we learn to follow their lead.`,\n      image: '/avatars/blank.png'\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'member-5',\n      name: 'Eduardo',\n      role: 'Dog Trainer',\n      description: `Eduardo's journey into dog training began during his college years while studying to become a teacher.
